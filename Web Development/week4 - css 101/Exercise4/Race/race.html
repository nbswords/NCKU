    over an elite field of the best long distance runners in the country. Julia's
    time of 2 hr. 28 min. 21 sec. was only 2 minutes off the women's course record
    set last year by Chelsea Williams of Chicago, Illinois. Katrina Larson and Belinda Paul
    finished second and third, respectively. Julia's victory came on the heels of her
    performance at the NCAA Track and Field Championships, in which she placed second running
    for Texas State.</p>

  <p style="color: #086eec; background-image: url(parch3.jpg);">In an exciting race, <b>Bill Dixon</b> of Los Angeles, California, used a finishing
    kick to win the men's marathon for the second straight year, in a time of
    2 hr. 12 min. 34 sec. Ahead for much of the race, Victor Fall of Jackson Hole, Wyoming,
    finished second, when he could not match Dixon's finishing pace. Charles Ross of
    Boston, Massachusetts, placed third in a very competitive field.</p>

  <p style="color: #2992ba; background-image: url(brnppr.gif);">This year's race through downtown Grapevine boasted the largest field in the
    marathon's history, with over 750 men and 470 women competing. Race conditions
    were perfect with low humidity and temperatures that never exceeded 85&deg;.</p>
